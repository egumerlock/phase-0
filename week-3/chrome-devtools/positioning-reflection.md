####How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
Chrome DevTools inspector gives you a visual environment along with a coding environment to change or create formatting elements for CSS.  It is also useful for looking at the existing code of any website you are interested in.
####How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
You can change the width and the height of an element using CSS on the DOM.  You do this by editing the existing CSS of a page.
####What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Static uses the normal behavior in which it is laid out in its current position within the flow.  Top, right, bottom, and left do not apply if positioned using static.  Fixed fixes the element to a specific position relative to the screen's viewport, and it does not move when scrolled.  This value creates a new stacking content.  Relative lays out the elements as though they were not positioned, then adjusts the elements position without changing layout.  Absolute does not leave space for the lement, and rather poistions it relative to its closest postioned ancestor or to the containing blocks.  They can have margins, and do not collapse with other margins.
Fixed is the easiest to use for me.  It is the most intuitive, and it just stays in the exact same place on the browser at all times.  It responds to margins as well.  Relative is the most difficult to comprehend, as it is relative to other elements within the page.  It is very difficult to place an element using this positioning unless you have the rest of your page set up the way you would like it to be.
####What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
Margin is the space between the element and either other elements or the side of the browswer.  Border is the border of an element, and padding is the amount of space between the content of the element and the border.
####What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
I found this to be a pretty tedious exercise although it also seems very necessary to get a good background in positioning.  While I didn't enjoy it, I think it brings to light subjects that we have to think about when creating a page.  This is definately one of the more difficult subjects of CSS.
