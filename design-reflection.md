What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
The Six Phases of Web Design are:
Information Gathering
Planning
Design
Development
Testing and Delivery
Maintenance

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My site’s primary purpose is to provide a summary of my professional background, with previous projects I have worked on, as well a short bio about me, my passions, and also a blog where I keep my thoughts and musings.  The content of my site will be the professional side of my evolution in web development.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My target audience’s interests are:
My web development projects
A background on who I am and what I stand for, how I work, what I like
An up to date area where they can read what I am currently working on

I see my site addressing each of these interests with a page or pages containing what prospective employers could be looking for.  My Projects page, which will likely be my homepage as well, will be the primary “meat” of the site where I will contain all work I have done in web development.  My Passions/About Me page will have a short bio on who I am, and why I do this kind of work, ways I like to work in, and creative processes as well as other passions.  My blog page will have the current and up-to-date status of what I am working on, and how I am faring in my journey in web development.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
I want the user to immediately be immersed with my portfolio, and then have options to contact me, read more about how I work and my passions, and perhaps even follow up with me on a blog.  The primary action though will be seeing my work.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
Design and user experience are relatively new fields in the web design business, and they focus on how a person feels when interfacing with a system.  UX is not a one size fits all type of design, and can’t be assessed with traditional metrics.  It is inherently more about the design and feeling a person gets when being immersed in the site/app/program.  It is also not quite the same as usability, it is a bit more creative than that, and less about the practicality of a site.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
User experience design is how a person feels when interfacing with a system.  It is valuable because now in the broad market of web development, it is important that each site/app/program stand out with its own personal touch of design.  While before it was normal for a one-size-fits-all design, now, people expect more of an experience from sites.  Also, it is a way to make the user feel a certain way about you, or your product/site.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Not much of the challenge was tedious.  I would say simply reading about UX design was a bit tedious since it never really explained how to do good UX design, it only described what UX design was not.
