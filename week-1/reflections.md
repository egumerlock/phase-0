# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
I learned a number of productivity ideas, some being the hard way is easier, as you create better habits which in turn are easier to keep up.  Start small and become big, starting with an MVP, a minimum viable product.  Practice in small increments to be able to push yourself harder, and also to give yourself rest.  We look to ourselves to tell us who we are, so create a habit, you will look better to yourself and it will bring you up in the long run.  Three elements cause a behavior, 1. Motivation, 2. Ability to do it, 3. a trigger and call to action.
  Time Boxing is the act of setting aside a period of time to complete a goal.  I am using it in Phase 0 to achieve different goals, for example using the Pomodoro technique (25 minute intervals with rewards after) to help increase studying efficiency and finish weekly tasks.
  Currently I manage my time by using a timer and intervals, after divvying up goals for the day into these interval segments.  I am also using the Tiny Habits technique to start creating new habits, freeing up more time for study.  Since I started the Tiny Habits technique today, I donâ€™t know if it is working yet, but the Time Boxing/Time Chunking technique has been very successful, especially with a small reward or rest afterwards.
  My overall plan for Phase 0 time management is to use Tiny Habits to free up more of my day for Phase 0 study, as well as use the Pomodoro technique to have efficient chunks of work time that lead to small rewards.  In this way I hope to achieve a quicker rate of study and also provide myself with a deeper focus, leading to deeper understanding of material.

## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
Shell is a term for the user interface with an operating system.  The shell is the entity of programming that understands and executes the commands a user enters, such as Linux or UNIX.  In some systems, the shell is called a command interpreter.  Bash is the shell written for UNIX in 1989.
  The most challenging part of the exercise was remembering the add-on commands such as -i or -p, and also where to place them.  Basically the commands were easy to memorize but the syntax was the tough thing to remember as it is very different from any syntax I have come in contact with.
  I was able to successfully use all of the commands, but a few were tougher to grapple with than others, especially the >, <, |, and >> commands which take a few mental seconds to figure out each time I typed one.  However, this will probably improve over time.
  -pwd - shows directory location
  -ls - lists directory files and directories
  -mv - moves an item
  -cd - change directory
  -../ - shows the type of folder you are in, or goes up one level after cd
  - touch - creates an empty text file
  -mkdir - make directory
  -less - page the content of a file
  -rmdir - remove directory
  -rm - remove
  -help - get help on a command, or -man - look at the manual for a command
