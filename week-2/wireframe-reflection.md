### What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is a sketched plan of the layout of your site.  It contains a prototype image of how your site might organize content.
### What are the benefits of wireframing?
Benefits of wireframing are that you have an “architectural” blueprint of your site to follow when trying to build it from the code up.  Also, it is very useful for determining how the user interacts with the interface.  For example, wireframes can contain various states of buttons or drop down menus, and other behaviors.
### Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
Yes, wire framing and designing is one of my favorite processes of web development so far, as it allows you to be creative and really delve into the world you are trying to create.
### Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I stuck with my first idea, since I liked the layout of the site and how it was looking.  Later I added social media links which didn’t interrupt the current layout flow.
### What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
I was having a lot of trouble getting my images to show in the browser, due to my lack of knowledge with writing a relative image path.  Doesn’t the relative image path start from the folder that the file is being kept in?  It didn’t seem to work that way for me.  I found few resources online, just played with it until it worked.
### Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I really enjoyed wire framing my site, and thinking about how the user will find all of the info I will include on it.  Designing in one of my favorite hobbies, and it really gets the creative juices flowing, as well as just simple inspiration.  I found trying to upload the finished prototype to git a little tedious, because I couldn’t get the image pathing to work for awhile, yet it was a good learning process.
