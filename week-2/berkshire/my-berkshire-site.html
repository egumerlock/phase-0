<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was smooth and didn't have many obstacles.  HTML is actually a very straightforward language it seems, and also the added ease of using JSfiddle.net helped the workflow without having to send an HTML file back and forth a bunch of times.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Using semantic HTML5 elements was helpful for us to always know where we were in the code.  Without sectioning, and using the footer, it would have been more confusing to realize where each piece of text/data went to.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
We always wanted to format using HTML, but remembered that next week we are going over CSS and formatting, so we kept each other in line about not formatting the entire exercise.  It did seem like a contradiction though that in the example, there was one `<hr>` used to section off the header, yet was not used in the rest of the example.  It confused us for awhile on what we were supposed to include in this exercise and what were not.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML seems like a great way to organize and section a website.  It seems like it would get very messy very quickly if you started to add style elements to every `<p>` and used breaks and horizontal rules.  I am sure that this is where CSS excels.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
My memory seems to be pretty good for writing HTML, although I do have the optional cheatsheet open in another tab at all times.  It helps to review the entire cheatsheet every time that I have to check up on something, furthering the memorization of all HTML commands.
