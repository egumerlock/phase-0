<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was a smooth transition from learning HTML basics to creating an actual site.  With the extra ease of using JSfiddle.net, our workflow was increased by not having to send an HTML file back and forth for checks.  HTML commands seem to work seamlessly.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
Researching and using semantic HTML5 elements such as sectioning, header, and footer, was really nice in organizing the structure of the HTML file.  It helps tremendously to know where you are within the section of you website, and allows you to never lose your place or add new content in the wrong spot.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I kept wanting to format in HTML, yet with the pairing, my partner always caught me and brought me back to good HTML practices.  It is tough when you don't see the site as you would like to it to be, to wait until CSS to go through and format your site.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML seems to be really great at organizing and sectioning a website into different pieces of text, and different pieces of data.  HTML is bad however, at formatting the data, as well as the text.  I am sure CSS excels at this, and we will be learning about it next week.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I have the optional cheatsheet open at all times, and when I need to check on an HTML code, I try to review the entire cheatsheet as to further the memorization and learning of HTML commands.  In this fashion, I get some extra practice.
