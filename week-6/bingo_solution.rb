# A Nested Array to Model a Bingo Board SOLO CHALLENGE

# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.


# Release 0: Pseudocode
# Outline:

# Create a method to generate a letter ( b, i, n, g, o) and a number (1-100)
# 1. .sample from array with b i n g o
# 2. rand(num) for a random number

# Check the called column for the number called.
# 1. Check the given array for number called

# If the number is in the column, replace with an 'x'

# Display a column to the console
#

# Display the board to the console (prettily)
  #fill in the outline here

# Initial Solution

class BingoBoard

  def initialize(board)
    @bingo_board = board
  end

  def call
    array =
  end

end

# Refactored Solution



#DRIVER CODE (I.E. METHOD CALLS) GO BELOW THIS LINE
board = [[47, 44, 71, 8, 88],
        [22, 69, 75, 65, 73],
        [83, 85, 97, 89, 57],
        [25, 31, 96, 68, 51],
        [75, 70, 54, 80, 83]]
