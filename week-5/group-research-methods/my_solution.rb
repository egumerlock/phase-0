# I spent [] hours on this challenge.

# Person 1's solution
def my_array_finding_method(source, thing_to_find)
  source # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

def my_hash_finding_method(source, thing_to_find)
  source # This line is here to make sure all tests initially fail. Delete it when you begin coding.
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.

# Person 2
# Pseudocode
# Input: Existing array, how many pets you want to add
# Output: Permanently modified new array with modified numbers, adding the amount of pets

def my_array_modification_method!(source, add_pets)
  source.map!{ |i| i.is_a?(Integer) ? i + add_pets : i}
end

def my_hash_modification_method!(source, add_age)
  source.each {|k, v| source[k] = v + add_age}
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# I implemented .map! for modifying an array destructively and .is_a?(Integer) ? to check for and modify integers only.
# I implemented .each to target each key of the hash, and saved them destructively via saving directly to the new value of the key.

# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.
#
#
#


# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
